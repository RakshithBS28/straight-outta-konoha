  "description": "Xiaomi's Indian debut has been causing all kinds of headaches for other smartphone companies. The Mi 3 offers an astonishing list of features and specifications considering its low price. The performance easily eclipses that of any other phone in its price band, and buyers who are lucky enough to snag one of the very few up for sale will be quite happy from that standpoint. The camera isn't all that great, and there's no microSD slot. The MiUI Android skin also takes some getting used to. If your primary concern is value for money, this is the phone to get, hands down.",
